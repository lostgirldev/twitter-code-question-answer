USER QUESTION: <mark>could you please give me an explanation on how eliza is leverage in goat_codebase? walk me through the code</mark>

<mark>SOLENG'S ANSWER:</mark>

I apologize, but after carefully reviewing all the provided code snippets, I cannot find any direct references to Eliza in the GOAT codebase. 

In the project overview, Eliza was mentioned briefly as one of the compatible agent frameworks:

```typescript
Key features
Works Everywhere: Compatible with Langchain, Vercel's AI SDK, Eliza, and more.
```

However, none of the code examples or plugin implementations show a concrete implementation or integration with Eliza. The code samples primarily demonstrate integrations with:
- Vercel AI SDK
- Langchain
- OpenAI models
- Various blockchain wallets and plugins

To provide a definitive answer about Eliza's leverage in the GOAT codebase, I would need to see specific code or documentation showing its implementation. 

Would you like me to elaborate on how the other agent frameworks are integrated, or do you have additional context about Eliza's role in the project?
